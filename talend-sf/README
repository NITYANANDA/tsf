Welcome to Talend Service Factory!
=====================================

Talend Service Factory (TSF) uses the industry leading open source 
Apache CXF implementation of JAX-WS to help you service enable your 
existing applications and interfaces.  The CXF lightweight, modular 
architecture is based on Spring, so it will work with your application 
regardless of the platform on which it is running.  It will run on 
stand-alone JVM applications, as part of a servlet container such as 
Tomcat, within a JEE server, or in an OSGi container such as Equinox.  

CXF supports Web Services using 
SOAP with full WS-*functionality including support for WS-Addressing,
WS-Reliable Messaging, and WS-Security over both HTTP and JMS transports.
CXF's elegantly simple architecture allows declarative, policy-centric 
support of these qualities of service through configuration rather than 
code.  It also supports non-SOAP bindings including REST.  CXF open 
standards and portability enable you to deliver interoperability for 
your applications to maximize the value of your application to your users.

The TSF distribution supplements the Apache CXF core with support for 
OSGi containers along with illustrative examples for how to implement 
different messaging qualities of service in different container 
environments.  CXF design-tools include support for Maven plug-ins,
WSDL tooling, and Spring 2.x XML configuration support.  TSF supplements
this with additional Maven archetypes to support development in an OSGi 
environment.

Apache CXF
==========

This package contains a complete version of Apache CXF, the industry 
leading open source solution for web services.  It also includes value
added components such as OSGi container and several new examples.
For more information about Apache CXF see http://cxf.apache.org/ .  


OSGi container 
============== 

The container subdirectory contains a preconfigured OSGi container that 
contains all the required OSGi bundles for the CXF 3rd party dependencies.
It also includes Apache Karaf to provide easy administration and 
configuration.  See the karaf-manual pdf file in the container directory 
for more information about Karaf.  For more information about OSGi and Apache 
Karaf see http://karaf.apache.org/ .

OSGi provides a mature, open standards based, highly modular framework for 
managing component dependencies, service invocation, and lifecycles.  It is 
the basis for Eclipse and provides a lightweight alternative to more 
monolithic JEE containers while still retaining the powerful management 
features necessary for the enterprise.


Lean Java 6 Distribution 
======================== 

The Talend Service Factory has been tuned for operation with Java 6.
lib/ - the contents of the lib directory have been optimized for use on 
Java 6.  Jars that are redundant to what is available in Java 6 have been 
removed.
