Welcome to Talend Service Factory Community Edition (CE)!
=========================================================

Talend Service Factory Community Edition (CE) uses the industry leading 
open source Apache CXF implementation of JAX-WS to help you service enable
your existing applications and interfaces.  The CXF lightweight, modular 
architecture is based on Spring, so it will work with your application 
regardless of the platform on which it is running.  It will run on 
stand-alone JVM applications, as part of a servlet container such as 
Tomcat, within a JEE server, or in an OSGi container such as Equinox.  

This package contains several new examples that show advanced features
of CXF.  All of the examples are setup to be built and run independently,
but they are also all setup to be run in the Talend Service Factory CE
OSGi container that can be obtained from:
http://www.talend.com/download.php#SF

jaxws-ws-trust: demonstrates having a SOAP client use CXF's stsclient 
to make a call to a Metro Secure Token Service (STS) and subsequently 
using the SAML token received to make a web service call to a CXF
web service provider.

jaxws-ws-secpol: demonstrates using WS-SecurityPolicy and configuration 
to secure communication between CXF client and servers using various
security requirements and including tokens like UsernameToken and
SAML assertions.

jaxws-jms-spec: demonstrates using JAX-WS clients and servers to
talk SOAP over JMS, but using the SOAP/JMS Specification for 
configuration.

interceptors: demonstrates how a message changes and is manipulated
as it passes through the various CXF interceptors.

jaxrs-intro: shows basic features of the the JAX-RS 1.1 specification 
and API such as root resources, subresources and HTTP verbs (GET/PUT/POST).  

jaxrs-advanced:  building on the jaxrs-intro sample, this demo additionally
demonstrates multiple root resource classes, recursive subresources, 
resource methods consuming and producing data in different formats (XML 
and JSON), using JAX-RS Response to return status, headers and optional 
entity, using UriInfo and UriBuilder for working with URI and 
ExceptionMappers for handling application exceptions.

jaxrs-attachments:  demonstrates how JAX-RS consumers and providers can 
read and write multipart attachments.

jaxrs-jaxws-authorization: shows how a Role-Base-Access-Control policy 
can be applied to JAX-WS and JAX-RS services with the help of the 
container-managed authentication and CXF security filters enforcing 
the authorization rules.

jaxrs-jaxws-description-first: shows how SOAP services created as
part of the document (WSDL) first approach process can get RESTified by having
a CXF JAX-RS user model resource added which describes how an interface 
generated by the wsdl-to-java tool can be treated as the JAX-RS root resource.

jaxrs-jaxws-java-first: shows how a single service instance can be
exposed as both JAX-RS and JAX-WS services at the same time and how CXF 
JAX-RS and JAX-WS proxies can reuse the same code for invoking on the 
corresponding endpoints.

jaxrs-jms-http: demonstrates how a JAX-RS HTTP server can be enhanced
to receive JMS messages.

jaxrs-transformations: demonstrates how CXF can help with maintaining
backward and forward compatibility between JAX-RS and JAX-WS consumers
and endpoints by using the Transformation Feature of CXF.

To build all examples:
===============================================================================

> cd examples
> mvn clean install

To prepare the TSF Container for the examples:
===============================================================================

Start TSF. From the TSF root directory:

> cd container
> bin/tsf

In the TSF shell:

> features:addurl mvn:com.talend.sf.examples/osgi/1.0/xml/features

This command adds the features repository for the examples to the container.  (See 
http://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest-2.2.x/users-guide/provisioning.html for
more details.)  This only needs to be done once for all examples.
