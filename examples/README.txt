The Examples Folder of Talend Services Factory contains the following samples:

JAXRS-Intro: Shows basic features of the the JAX-RS 1.1 specification and API[2].  
Root resources, subresources, HTTP Verbs (GET/PUT/POST).

JAXRS-Advanced:  Building on (but separate from) the JAXRS-Intro sample, this
demo shows more advanced features of the JAX-RS 1.1 Specification and API.
Covered are multiple JAX-RS root resource classes, recursive JAX-RS
sub-resources, resource method consuming and producing data in different
formats (XML and JSON), using the JAX-RS Response object to return status, 
headers and optional entities, using JAX-RS UriInfo and UriBuilder for 
creating LINK headers, adding URI query parameters, and JAX-RS 
ExceptionMappers for handling exceptions thrown from the application code.

JAXRS-JAXWS-Description First:  The demo shows how SOAP services created as
part of the document (WSDL) first approach process can get RESTified by having
a CXF JAX-RS user model resource added which describes how an interface 
generated by the wsdl-to-java tool can be treated as the JAX-RS root resource.

JAXRS-JAXWS-Java First: The demo shows how a single service instance can be
exposed as both JAX-RS and JAX-WS services at the same time and how CXF 
JAX-RS and JAX-WS proxies can reuse the same code for invoking on the 
corresponding endpoints.

JAXRS-JMS-HTTP: This sample demonstrates how a JAX-RS HTTP server can be enhanced
to receive JMS messages.

Interceptors: This sample demonstrates how a message changes and is manipulated
as it passes through the various interceptors.

JAXWS-JMS-Spec: This sample demonstrates use of the Document-Literal style 
binding over the SOAP/JMS Specification transport.
