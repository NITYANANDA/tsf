The Examples Folder of Talend Services Factory contains the following samples:

jaxws-jms-spec: demonstrates the use of the Document-Literal style 
binding over the SOAP/JMS Specification transport.

interceptors: demonstrates how a message changes and is manipulated as it passes through the various CXF interceptors.

jaxrs-intro: shows basic features of the the JAX-RS 1.1 specification and API such as root resources, subresources and HTTP verbs (GET/PUT/POST).  

jaxrs-advanced:  building on the jaxrs-intro sample, this demo additionally demonstrates multiple root resource classes, recursive subresources, resource methods consuming and producing data in different formats (XML and JSON), using JAX-RS Response to return status, headers and optional entity, using UriInfo and UriBuilder for working with URI and ExceptionMappers for handling application exceptions.

jaxrs-jaxws-authorization: shows how a Role-Base-Access-Control policy can be applied to JAX-WS and JAX-RS services with the help of the container-managed authentication and CXF security filters enforcing the authorization rules.

jaxrs-jaxws-description-first: shows how SOAP services created as
part of the document (WSDL) first approach process can get RESTified by having
a CXF JAX-RS user model resource added which describes how an interface 
generated by the wsdl-to-java tool can be treated as the JAX-RS root resource.

jaxrs-jaxws-java-first: shows how a single service instance can be
exposed as both JAX-RS and JAX-WS services at the same time and how CXF 
JAX-RS and JAX-WS proxies can reuse the same code for invoking on the 
corresponding endpoints.

jaxrs-jms-http: demonstrates how a JAX-RS HTTP server can be enhanced
to receive JMS messages.
