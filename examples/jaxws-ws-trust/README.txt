WS-Trust
=================================

Provides an example of a CXF SOAP client (WSC) accessing a Metro STS for a SAML assertion and then subsequently
making a call to a CXF web service provider (WSP).  Two WSC->STS calls are made, one using UsernameToken 
authentication and the other X.509 authentication, but in both cases the same SAML assertion is provided to
the WSP.  Sample keystores and truststores for the WSC, WSP, and STS are provided in this project but are of course
not meant for production use.


Important Note:  By default, this example uses strong encryption which is 
recommended for use in production systems.  To run this example "out of the
box", you MUST have the "Java(TM) Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited 
Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files" installed into your JRE.  See your
JRE provider for more information. (For Oracle JDK6, the download is available here:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html, see the README
file from the download for installation instructions.)
   
Alternatively, you can change to using a lower end encyption algorithm by editing
the security policies in:

service-war/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/wsdl/DoubleIt.wsdl 
client/src/main/resources/DoubleItSTSService.wsdl 
sts-war/bin/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/wsdl/DoubleItSTSService.wsdl 
sts-war/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/wsdl/DoubleItSTSService.wsdl 
common/src/main/resources/ws-trust-common/DoubleIt.wsdl  
common/src/main/resources/ws-trust-common/DoubleItSTSService.wsdl

to change from "Basic256" to "Basic128".   If you receive an error like 
"Illegal key length" when running the demo, you need to change to Basic128 or
install the Unlimited Strength encryption libraries.

How to Deploy:

1.) The Metro STS requires the newer 2.2.x versions 
of JAX-WS and JAXB (included in the JAX-WS download) not provided by default 
in Java SE 6.  Download JAX-WS V 2.2.x from http://jax-ws.java.net/ and place the 
jaxb-api.jar and jaxws-api.jar in your JDK's JDK_HOME/JRE/lib/endorsed folder.

2.) The STS and WSP run on standalone Tomcat Version 7.  If not already done, 
configure Maven to be able to install 
and uninstall the WSP and the STS by following this section: 
http://www.jroller.com/gmazza/entry/web_service_tutorial#maventomcat.  Also start up Tomcat.

3.) From the root jaxws-ws-trust, folder, run "mvn clean install".  If no errors, can then 
run "mvn tomcat:deploy" (or tomcat:undeploy or tomcat:redeploy on subsequent runs as appropriate),
either from the same folder (to deploy the STS and WSP at the same time) or separately, one at a time,
from the service-war and sts folders.

Before proceeding to the next step, make sure you can view the following WSDLs:
Metro STS WSDL located at: http://localhost:8080/DoubleItSTS/DoubleItSTSServiceUT
CXF WSP: http://localhost:8080/doubleit/services/doubleitUT?wsdl

4.) Navigate to the client folder:

 * To run the client in a standalone manner, run mvn clean install exec:exec.
 * Alternatively, it is possible to run the client from within the OSGi
   container. One thing to be aware of is that the default port for Tomcat
   (8080) will conflict with the OPS4J Pax Web - Jetty bundle loaded by Karaf.
   Therefore, start Karaf, and stop the Pax Jetty bundle before starting Tomcat.

   From the OSGi command line, run:
      karaf@tsf> features:install tsf-example-jaxws-ws-trust-client

Either way, you should see the results of three web service calls, with the client using
UsernameToken in one call, and X.509 in the other to get the SAML Assertion. 
The third web service call uses a SAML2 Assertion.

For DEBUGGING:

1.) Activate client-side logging by uncommenting the logging feature in the client's resources/cxf.xml file.
The log4j.properties file in the same folder can be used to adjust the amount of logging received.

2.) Activate service-side logging by editing the log4j.properties file in the service's resources folder.

3.) Check the logs directory under your Tomcat folder (cataling.log, catalina(date).log in particular) for
any errors reported by the WSP or the STS.

4.) Use Wireshark to view messages:
