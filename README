Welcome to Talend Service Factory!
=====================================

Talend Service Factory (TSF) uses the industry leading open source 
Apache CXF implementation of JAX-WS to help you service enable your 
existing applications and interfaces.  The CXF lightweight, modular 
architecture is based on Spring, so it will work with your application 
regardless of the platform on which it is running.  It will run on 
stand-alone JVM applications, as part of a servlet container such as 
Tomcat, within a JEE server, or in an OSGI container such as Equinox.  

CXF supports Web Services using 
SOAP with full WS-*functionality including support for WS-Addressing,
WS-Reliable Messaging, and WS-Security over both HTTP and JMS transports.
CXF elegantly simple architecture allows declarative, policy-centric 
support of these qualities of service through configuration rather than 
code.  It also supports non-SOAP bindings including REST.  CXF open 
standards and portability enable you to deliver interoperability for 
your applications to maximize the value of your application to your users.

The TSF distribution supplements the Apache CXF core with support for 
OSGI containers along with illustrative examples for how to implement 
different messaging qualities of service in different container 
environments.  CXF design-tools include support for Maven plug-ins,
WSDL tooling, and Spring 2.x XML configuration support.  TSF supplements
this with additional Maven archetypes to support development in an OSGI 
environment.
